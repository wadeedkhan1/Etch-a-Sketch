Welcome to the Etch-A-Sketch project! This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum and involves creating a browser version of an Etch-A-Sketch toy using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below, you'll find an overview of the project and a reflection on the skills gained throughout its completion.

## Project Overview

### Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to create an interactive Etch-A-Sketch toy that allows users to draw on a grid by hovering their mouse over it. The project aims to provide a fun and engaging way to practice DOM manipulation and event handling with JavaScript.

### Skills Demonstrated

Throughout the project, I demonstrated proficiency in several key areas of web development, including:
